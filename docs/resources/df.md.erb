# df

Use the `df` InSpec resource to audit filesystem disk space usage
<br>

## Syntax

A `df` resource block declares tests for disk space in a partion:

    describe df('/') do
      its('size') { should be >= 32000 }
    end

where

* `df('/')` states that it will be looking at the root (/) partition
* `size` is measured in megabytes (MB)

<br>

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test if the root partition is greater thank 32000 MB

    describe df('/') do
      its('size') { should be >= 32000 }
    end
