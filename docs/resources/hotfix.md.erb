## Syntax

    describe hotfix('name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `('name')` must specify the name of a hotfix, such as `'KB4012213'`
* `be_installed` is a valid matcher for this resource

## Matcher

### be_installed

The `be_installed` matcher tests if the named hotfix is installed on the system:

    it { should be_installed }
