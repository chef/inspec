title: About the cpan Resource

# cpan

Use the `cpan` InSpec audit resource to test Perl modules that are installed by system packages or the CPAN installer.

## Syntax

A `cpan` resource block declares a package and (optionally) a package version:

    describe cpan('package_name') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

where

* `'package_name'` is the name of the package, such as `'DBD::Pg'`
* `be_installed` tests to see if the package described above is installed


## Matchers

This InSpec audit resource has the following matchers:

### be

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_be" %>

### be_installed

The `be_installed` matcher tests if the named package is installed on the system:

    it { should be_installed }

### cmp

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_cmp" %>

### eq

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_eq" %>

### include

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_include" %>

### match

<%= partial "/shared/matcher_match" %>

### version

The `version` matcher tests if the named package version is on the system:

    its('version') { should eq '1.2.3' }

## Examples

The following examples show how to use this InSpec audit resource.

### Test if DBD::Pg is installed on the system

    describe cpan('DBD:Pg') do
      it { should be_installed }
    end

### Test if DBD::Pg 3.7.0 is installed on the system

    describe cpan('Jinja2') do
      it { should be_installed }
      its('version') { should eq '3.7.0' }
    end
